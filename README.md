# pionsgaussian

This is a creates a graph using the equation given in PIONEER research which is a gussian graph. It is more precise equation than previous research in PIENU.
The guassian curve is not as important as the area under the curve.
First, this integration gives us a number in which we use to normalize the percentage, since percentage has to be out of 100%, never out of some other number.

At the moment, our peak is 1, as it should be since 1 = 100%.

The area is used to divide by the number we multiply to normalize the percentage, since we want the percentage to be out of 100%, not like out of 99% or 50%. Always 100%.

This will show us the number of sterile neutrino we will theoretically find.
